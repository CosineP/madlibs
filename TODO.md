here's what i wanna do

- toot from a random template occasionally
  - do i wanna live read the notis every time or store them? store them
    - the real struggle here is getting the backlog of notifications. i can just
      ignore this problem at first
  - how often? i'm thinking daily, at a random time

- MANUAL MADLIBS!! i think this is a really important part of the madlibs
  experience and i'd like to enable it. ofcourse, it's going to take a lot of
  extra processing and be difficult so,
