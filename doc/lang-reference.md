how do i make a template anyway
===============================

any text not in braces is consider raw text, it is unedited. any html in the
toot is stripped, but the contained text remains

so you can put words (a part-of-speech) into `[]` brackets to indicate a word to
be replaced, like an underline in madlibs. here are the words you can use at
this time:

| word        | example |
| ----------- | ------- |
| adjective   | slimy   |
| comparative | warmer  |
| superlative | coolest |
| noun        | volcano |
| nouns       | sheep   |
| proper      | John    |
| propers     | Alices  |
| pronoun     | she     |
| possessive  | his     |
| adverb      | sweetly |
| uh          | uh      |
| verb        | eat     |
| verbs       | eats    |
| past        | ate     |
| participle  | eaten   |
| verbing     | eating  |
| question    | what    |

you may NOT nest `[]` brackets. using `[]` brackets with an incorrect word will
have it filled with a random word
